# Sound Effects for Quiz Component

This directory contains sound effects used by the quiz component.

## Required Files

1. `correct.mp3` - Sound played when a user selects the correct answer
2. `incorrect.mp3` - Sound played when a user selects the incorrect answer

## How to Add Sound Files

You can add your own sound files by:

1. Finding royalty-free sound effects online (e.g., from [Freesound](https://freesound.org/))
2. Converting them to MP3 format if necessary
3. Naming them `correct.mp3` and `incorrect.mp3`
4. Placing them in this directory

## Temporary Solution

If you don't have sound files available, the quiz component will gracefully handle their absence and continue to function without sound effects.
