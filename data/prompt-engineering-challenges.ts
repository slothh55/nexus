Imagine if your toys could learn what games you like to play, or if your video game could create new levels just for you. AI is used in lots of things you might know - like when your tablet suggests videos you might like, or when a video game character makes decisions. It's a bit like teaching a robot to think, but it can only think about specific things it's been trained to understand.

Sam discovered a talent for spotting unusual bottle caps, starting a collection that soon filled a corner of the treehouse.\n\nWhen a storm damaged part of their treehouse, Sam used knowledge from a previous school's woodworking class to help repair it.\n\n\"See?\" Jordan said as they admired their fixed clubhouse. \"Everyone has something special to share.

    exampleResponse: "I'd be happy to help you understand percentages! Since you're in 6th grade and already know how to convert between fractions and decimals, let's focus on calculating percentage increases, which can be tricky at first.\n\nWhen we talk about a percentage increase, we're finding out how much something has grown compared to its original value.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. Find the amount of increase: New Value - Original Value\n2. Divide that increase by the Original Value\n3. Multiply by 100 to get the percentage\n\nLet's use your example about saving money:\n\nIf you had $50 last month and now have $65:\n1. Increase = $65 - $50 = $15\n2. $15 รท $50 = 0.3\n3. 0.3 ร 100 = 30%\n\nSo your savings increased by 30%!\n\nThis is useful for understanding growth in many real-life situations, like population changes, price increases, or tracking improvements in test scores.\n\nWould you like to try a practice problem to make sure you understand?",

      excellent: "Excellent prompt! You've specifically requested diverse role models across multiple dimensions (gender, ethnicity, ability, etc.) for elementary students. Your prompt encourages the AI to provide examples from different backgrounds, time periods, and STEM disciplines, ensuring students from all backgrounds can see themselves represented in STEM fields.",
      good: "Good prompt! You've asked for diverse STEM role models for elementary students. To make it even better, you could specifically mention the types of diversity you're looking for (such as gender, ethnicity, disability, country of origin) to ensure truly inclusive representation.",
      fair: "Your prompt mentions diversity but could be more specific. When requesting inclusive content, it helps to explicitly ask for representation across multiple dimensions (gender, ethnicity, ability status, etc.) and from different time periods and regions to ensure truly diverse examples.",
      poor: "Your prompt doesn't effectively emphasize the importance of diversity and inclusion. When asking for role models for students, it's important to specifically request diverse representation so that all students can see people like themselves in STEM fields.",
      prohibited: "Your prompt contains language that limits diversity rather than encourages it. Phrases like 'only women' or 'normal scientists' create exclusionary boundaries. Instead, ask for diverse representation across all dimensions to ensure all students can see themselves reflected in STEM."

    exampleResponse: "# Understanding Both Sides: Social Media and Teenagers\n\n## Arguments That Social Media Benefits Teenagers\n\n**1. Social Connection and Support**\n- Research shows social media helps teens maintain friendships, especially during periods when they can't meet in person\n- Provides support communities for teens with specific interests or challenges\n- Allows shy or socially anxious teens to connect in more comfortable ways\n- Evidence: A Pew Research study found 81% of teens say social media makes them feel more connected to friends\n\n**2. Identity Exploration and Self-Expression**\n- Offers spaces for creative expression and developing personal identity\n- Allows teens to find communities with shared interests or experiences\n- Can boost confidence when receiving positive feedback\n- Evidence: Research in the Journal of Adolescent Health found positive self-presentation online can improve self-esteem\n\n**3. Information Access and Learning**\n- Exposes teens to diverse perspectives and global events\n- Provides educational content in engaging formats\n- Teaches digital literacy skills needed for future careers\n- Evidence: Common Sense Media research shows many teens use social media for homework help and learning new skills\n\n## Arguments That Social Media Harms Teenagers\n\n**1. Mental Health Concerns**\n- Associated with increased anxiety, depression, and poor body image in some studies\n- Can create unhealthy comparison with curated, unrealistic portrayals of others' lives\n- May contribute to sleep disruption when used at night\n- Evidence: A study in JAMA Psychiatry found teens who use social media more than 3 hours daily may have higher risk of mental health problems\n\n**2. Social Pressures and Cyberbullying**\n- Creates new avenues for bullying that can feel inescapable\n- May increase social pressure and fear of missing out (FOMO)\n- Can lead to unhealthy validation-seeking behaviors\n- Evidence: About 59% of teens have experienced cyberbullying according to the Cyberbullying Research Center\n\n**3. Privacy and Safety Concerns**\n- Teens may not fully understand the permanence of digital footprints\n- Data collection practices raise privacy concerns\n- Potential exposure to inappropriate content or predatory behavior\n- Evidence: Studies show many teens share personal information without understanding potential consequences\n\n## Balanced Perspective\n\nMost research suggests that social media itself isn't inherently good or bad - its impact depends on:\n- How it's used (passive scrolling vs. active engagement)\n- How much it's used (moderate vs. excessive use)\n- Individual factors (personality, mental health, social support)\n- Platform design and features\n\n## Forming Your Own Opinion\n\nWhen developing your position, consider:\n1. Looking at quality research rather than anecdotes\n2. Considering how different teens might be affected differently\n3. Thinking about potential solutions that maximize benefits while reducing harms\n4. Reflecting on your own experiences and observations\n\nRemember that nuanced positions that acknowledge both benefits and drawbacks are often more accurate than all-or-nothing views.",

      excellent: "Excellent prompt! You've asked for balanced perspectives on both sides of the social media debate, specifically requested evidence-based information, and emphasized that you want to form your own opinion based on the facts. This approach encourages critical thinking and helps you understand complex issues from multiple angles.",
      good: "Good prompt! You've asked for both sides of the debate about social media for teenagers. To make it even better, you could specifically request evidence-based information and emphasize that you want to understand the nuances rather than just getting a simple answer.",
      fair: "Your prompt asks for information about the debate, but could be more specific about wanting balanced perspectives. When researching controversial topics, it's important to explicitly request evidence from both sides and clarify that you want to form your own opinion rather than being told what to think.",
      poor: "Your prompt doesn't effectively emphasize the need for balanced perspectives. When asking about debate topics, it's important to specifically request both sides of the argument, evidence-based information, and clarify that you want to understand the issue rather than being given a one-sided view.",
      prohibited: "Your prompt suggests you're looking for the AI to complete your assignment rather than help you understand the topic. Phrases like 'write my essay' or 'do my homework' encourage academic dishonesty.
